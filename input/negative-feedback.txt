I've been a loyal customer for over 3 years, but my recent experience was absolutely terrible. The premium headphones I ordered arrived 2 weeks late despite paying for expedited shipping. When the package finally arrived, the box was damaged and one of the headphones had a cracked housing.

The sound quality was disappointing with constant buzzing in the left ear piece. Customer service put me on hold for 45 minutes, transferred me 3 times, and the final representative was rude and unhelpful. They told me I couldn't get a full refund after 16 days, only store credit.

I paid $300 for premium product and service but received neither. I'm seriously considering switching to your competitor if this isn't resolved immediately. I expect either a full refund or replacement shipped overnight at no charge, plus compensation for my time and frustration.
