    "feedback": "I recently purchased your wireless earbuds and wanted to share my experience. The ordering process was straightforward and the product arrived within the expected timeframe. The packaging was adequate and everything was included as described.\n\nThe sound quality is decent for the price point, though I've heard better from other brands. The battery life meets the advertised specifications. Setup was relatively easy, though the mobile app could be more intuitive. \n\nCustomer service was responsive when I had a question about warranty coverage. Overall, it's an acceptable product that does what it's supposed to do. Not exceptional, but not disappointing either. I might consider other options for my next purchase, but this serves its purpose for now.",
