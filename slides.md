# ðŸ¦œðŸ”— LangChain.js

- Simplifies working with LLMs in `JavaScript/TypeScript` by providing tools:
  - to manage prompts
  - to model calls
  - and output parsing
- Making it easier to build robust AI-powered applications and workflows.
- Using the following LangChain.js packages:
  - `langchain@0.3.0`
  - `@langchain/core@0.3.0`
  - `langchain/google-genai@0.1.0`
- NOTE:
  - There is also `LangChain` for `Python`

# Intro

- Using `gemini-2.0-flash` LLM by Google, get a free API key on [AI Studio](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjPtaqyiJKPAxUjj4kEHSNDEjQQFnoECAoQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Faistudio.google.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw2ado6WVRi8CYsaHcreSChK&opi=89978449)
  - `temperature` controls the randomness of the output, range: `[0, 1]`
- `promptTemplate` is the prompt to be sent to the LLM, it expects 2 arguments:
  - `topic`
  - `nbWords`
- `stringOutputParser` is a way to instruct the LLM to return the response as `string`
- `chain` is what we call a Runnable, the `chain` is simple for now, and in this case it means
  > send the `promptTemplate` to the `model` and return the response as `stringOutputParser`

---

- Lastly, the actual chain invocation with `chain.invoke()` happens where:

  - we pass `topic` and `nbWords` as parameters
  - store the result in `result`

- NOTE:
  - IntelliSense will complain if there is a mismatch in the prompt variable names (show example)

# Feedback Analyzer

- the `feedback-analyzer` processes customer feedback by chaining 3 AI-powered analyses:

  1. Assesses the sentiment from the feedback
  2. Identifies the issues
  3. Suggests actions to mitigate the issues found

- Returns a comprehensive report in a JSON format

---

- Sentiment chain:
  - receives as input `feedback`
  - outputs: `sentiment`
- Issues chain:
  - received as input `feedback` and `sentiment`
  - outputs: `issues`
- Actions chain:

  - receives as input: `feedback`, `sentiment`, and `issues`
  - outputs: `actions`

---

- Assemble `feedback`, `sentiment`, `issues`, and `actions` into a single comprehensive JSON file
